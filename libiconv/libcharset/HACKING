All you need to know when hacking (modifying) GNU libcharset or when building
it off the Git repository.


Requirements
============

You will need reasonably recent versions of the build tools:

  * A C compiler. Such as GNU GCC.
    + Homepage:
      https://gcc.gnu.org/

  * GNU autoconf
    + Homepage:
      https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

  * GNU m4
    + Homepage:
      https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/

  * Perl
    + Homepage:
      https://www.perl.org/

And, of course, the packages listed in the DEPENDENCIES file.


Building off the Git repository
===============================

Access to the Git repository is described at
https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=libiconv .

After fetching the sources from the Git repository, peek at the comments in
autogen.sh, then run "./autogen.sh"; then you can proceed with "./configure"
as usual.
