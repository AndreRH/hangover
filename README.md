This branch is work in progress

In fact it will use upcoming WOW64 support in Wine + an emulator to run e.g. ARM32 on x86_64 or i386 on ARM64.

## Hangover-next
This is branch will be merged as soon as enough parts are ready.

### 1) Todo

* Get i386 on ARM64 working. (partly depends on [Wine Bug 53682](https://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=53682) )
* Figure out 64on64 (for e.g. x86_64 on ARM64)
* Get all requirements into one place
* Add some kind of a build system?
* Integrate other emulators than Qemu, like Box32, FEX/AEX
